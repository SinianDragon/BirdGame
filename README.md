This is my first hand-coded game, powered by java only.

Of course i refered to some java books and lessons which taught me how to made a small java game.

some codes were originally from these books and lessons website( for example biliili which is a chinese "youtube")

There are some many problems left to solve, but due to time was limited back then, i had to finish this game in a very,you can say,rough way.
